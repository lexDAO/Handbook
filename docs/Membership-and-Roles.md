# LexDAO Membership & Roles - DRAFT

## Membership:
* Community Member (Default)
* Apprentice
* Legal Engineer (Base Class Rogue)

## Roles:
Thinking we reference Raid Guild schemes for the classes here, but I think these are the possible "specializations":
* Front End Dev
* Backend Dev
* Web 3 Dev (blockchain, smart contract)
* Data Science, Analytics, Metadata, Search
* Legal Research
* Product & Technology
* Community Manager / Vote Master
* Content & Communications
* Designer (UI/UX)
* Biz Dev or Customer Acquisition
* Treasury
* Mediator or Arbitrator
* Licensed Attorney

## Becoming an Apprentice: 

1. A champion supports your vote.
2. Vote passes.

## Becoming a Legal Engineer:
4. Complete minimum apprenticeship to earn 10 LXK; or
5. Prove equivalent experience (show code).

## Further Qualifications:
I think this is where it's really Skill Tree crazy. This is sub skill specialization.

This is where all the "Alternate Career" Stuff can live within the framework - essentially sub specs based on class.

1. Cybersecurity
2. Computational Forensics
3. Lex Cryptographer

## Alternate Career:
The traditional ladder is intern->associate->(near burnout)->partner with starting own boutique practice (alternative clerk->prosecutor->judge) with sidelines in politics. Paralegal might be employee->legalExec->busDev. The computational law path offer more entry points, but looks forward to software/algorithms eating traditional black letter law. Some speculative job descriptions:

* unilateral dispute resolution - under economic tort, when the tortfeasor cannot be identified, identify recourse based on blockchain evidence which is fair and proportionate;
* concilitator - apply human law (resolve antagonistic feelings) rather than strict contract remedy;
* forensics - data mining to gather evidence and ensure chain of custody for prosecution;
