Welcome to the LexDAO Handbook repo. Right now there is a markdown file for every "Chapter." This is the organizational scheme we'll use to publish it eventually via something like Docusaurus.

If you're interested in contributing feel free to fork the repo and submit edits via Pull Request.

LexDAO Members -> I've you'd like to join the handbook conversations, we're coordinating handbook development through our Discord server: https://discord.gg/5TFX9Xd
