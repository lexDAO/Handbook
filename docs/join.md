# How to join LexDAO!

### Step 1: Fill out the "Join Us" form. 
Found on https://lexdao.coop, this form will help us gather a bunch of the information we need to process your membership once you've cleared the rest of the process and so we can make LexDAO the best experience for everyone.

### Step 2: Join our Discord
We do most of our communication and coordination via our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/qbUhmH4). If you haven't already, jump in over there and say hello.

### Step 3: Attend a Call
LexDAO is largely a club built on a level of social trust. The easiest next step is to attend one of our open calls. You can find them on our [open events calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=anVyaXNwcm9qZWN0LmlvXzdyNzdrbHVwMGdmMGJodWJrMmo3bmEwc21jQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20). They all take place in voice/video channels on Discord. Every week we have a community call which we call "The Council of Rogues" (the name is a long story we're happy to share on the call ðŸ˜œ) and a hack call where we work on coding stuff together.

### Step 4: Submit Your Membership Proposal
*(Note: Please complete the steps above before submitting your proposal. Failure to do so may result in voting delays, which may cause your proposal to time out or fail.)*

The next step is to submit your official DAO proposal. You'll start that [here](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x58234d4bf7a83693dc0815d97189ed7d188f6981/proposals/new) by selecting "Membership" under proposal which will bring up this window ðŸ‘‡

Please fill out the following information:
**Proposal Title:** "New Member:" followed by your name. Example: New Member: Homer Simpson 

**Description:** Write a few sentences about yourself.

**Link:** Please link to an external social
profile. This is usually something like Twitter.

**Shares Requested:** 10 shares for full tribute member. 1 share if you plan to apprentice to earn your tribute.

**Token Tribute:** 
Full Members - 300 WXDAI ($300)
Apprentice Members - 0 WXDAI

**That's it.** There are some additional options, but if you're just trying to join the DAO, that's all you need. When you proposal is submitted let your champion know, or let us know in Discord. We'll make sure it's addressed and voted on by the DAO.

> **Note:** LexDAO runs on xDAI an Ethereum sister chain which runs on DAI, a $1 pegged stablecoin. This makes it so we have much lower transaction fees and times when doing DAO business.

> If you need help with this, please contact your champion, or double back to find one. We're always happy to help you out.

### Step 5: Find a Sponsor
This is super easy if you've come by one of our open calls. But we also understand that group calls aren't for everyone, so we don't want to make that a requirement. Anyway, you'll need to find someone to sponsor your DAO proposal, and potentially help you with some of the specifics. If you're in search of a champion you can also drop a message in the "Sponsor-Needed" channel. Be sure to tag "@Guild Members" to make sure a member of the DAO sees it!
