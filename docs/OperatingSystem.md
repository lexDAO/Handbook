# Operating System {#operating-system}

## Foundational Materials {#foundational-materials}

### What is LexDAO? {#what-is-lexdao?}

* LexDAO is a non-profit association of legal engineering professionals that brings the traditional legal settlement layer to code, and coded agreements to the masses. We believe that everyone deserves access to justice provided in a quick and efficient manner. If legal services were easier to use, verify, and enforce, we could live in a fairer world. Blockchain technology offers solutions to many problems in the legal space.

### Mission and Strategy {#mission-and-strategy}

* Our mission is to research, develop and evangelize first-class legal methods and blockchain protocols that secure rules and promises with code rather than trust. We do this by training LexDAO certified legal engineers and buidling LexDAO certified blockchain applications. We strive to balance new deterministic tools with the equitable considerations of law to better serve our clients, allies, and ultimately citizens.

### Long-Term Goals and Strategy: How to Achieve Our Mission {#long-term-goals-and-strategy:-how-to-achieve-our-mission}

When we have to rank projects against each other, whether to allocate budget or for other reasons, we should use the goals as the criteria.

* Grow.  
  * Grow the DAO. Let’s get big. No limiting of people. The more people we have, the more of an impact we can have and the more likely we are to achieve our mission and goals. If we have the right operating system, we’ll smoothly onboard anyone interested.  
* Reward.  
  * Recognise and reward the value. The people who do the work get the benefits.  
* Build.  
  * Build products that move forward legal engineering and law in the cryptoverse.  
* Educate.  
  * Educate lawyers on blockchain, crypto, web3 to have lawyers ready to work on behalf of the space. Raise awareness of developers/founders as to the real-world legal implications of what they do.  
* Help.  
  * Use legal engineering and the law to move forward crypto projects.  
* Advocate.  
  * Submit public comments to regulatory, governmental, and standards bodies in support of the crypto industry and best practices  
* Platform.  
  * Be a platform for members launching legal crypto projects, gain expertise, earn income, and support public goods.  
* Earn.  
  * Generate revenue from products and services to reinvest in furthering the DAO mission and supporting our members.

### Why have DAOops and an Operating System? {#why-have-daoops-and-an-operating-system?}

* Efficiency: Rules and documentation let the org run itself (dAo \= Autonomous), as much as possible.  
* Empowerment, Autonomy, and Happiness: Give people the guidelines on how to work within the LexDAO system so they can be empowered to launch and run projects.  
* Value: Efficiency \+ Empowerment \= Value Creation  
* Consistency and Fairness: Without rules, the loudest voices, the sharpest elbows, the most entitled people win. Let’s ensure the people who add the most value and act consistently with our good people culture are the winners.  
* Lots of other ways to say it. [Read](https://nycoo.org/2019/02/25/your-startup-needs-an-operating-system/) [more](https://nycoo.org/2021/06/24/your-dao-still-needs-an-operating-system/) if you love operations as much as certain people do.

### Operating Principles {#operating-principles}

* Owners of everything. Tag the owner with relevant items in discord. Give them ideas and feedback, empower them to act on it.  
* Use systems, rules, and documentation to empower people to know how to propose and run projects.

## Project Tiers {#project-tiers}

### Tier 1: Minor & Incubator {#tier-1:-minor-&-incubator}

* For smaller projects, working groups, and early stage projects  
* Any Tier 2 Certified Member can launch a Tier 1 Project, no approval, and get a Discord channel.

### Tier 2: Major {#tier-2:-major}

Tier 2 Projects are the bigger initiatives LexDAO is working on.

* How to propose a new Tier 2 project:  
  * Answer the question listed below, then follow the [process for any voting decision](\#how-we-make-decisions,-governance,-voting,-requesting-funding).  
* Mission: Why are we doing this project? How does it fit the DAO Goals?  
* Long-Term Goals: What is this project trying to accomplish?  
  * Probably short-term goals too, but that’s up to the project team  
* Team  
  * Project Owner, at least, as a go-to point of contact  
    * Who are you? What have you done for LexDAO? What CREDs have you earned?  
  * List of other members and roles is recommended, including opportunities for new members to get involved and junior members to learn  
* Budget  
  * Source of startup and long-term funding  
    * Grant, revenue, fundraising  
    * Request for funds from DAO, and how/if the DAO and/or the world will be repaid for that  
    * Rough spreadsheet of the money coming in and going out, with where it’s going  
  * Revenue or Grant Distribution Plan  
    * If the Project will receive revenue, grants, investments, or other kinds of funding of any kind, then include the distribution plan:  
      * 10% of all incoming funds of any kind and 10% of tokens to LexDAO treasury for brand, DAOops, and other support  
      * Each project decides where the other 90% goes  
        * 10% LexDAO, 20% Tier 2 Project Team, 70% Implementation Team might make sense in some cases (LexEd)  
        * Referral / sourcing / finder fees  
    * Compensation, financials, loot  
* Crypto account, with multi-sig capabilities and list of signers, every Tier 2 Project that will use funds in any way should have its own account, maybe under a parent account  
* Legal structure: Part of UNA? Part of LLC? Series LLC? Separate LLC? Non-US entity like Cayman Foundation?  
* [Project Plan example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ee4pa\_866lZpVapU27CH5tq0s4CMUk8Z-d\_ap0jla\_c/edit\#)  
* How will you communicate?  
  * Tier 2 project owner decides on what discord channels to have and who is in the discord channels, can be whoever they want  
  * Need a google group for calendar invitations, permissioned google docs, and email? Create it under [lexdaocoop@gmail.com](mailto:lexdaocoop@gmail.com)  
* How will you share information?  
  * Need a google drive folder? Create it under lexdaocoop@gmail.com

### Tier 3: Space Launch {#tier-3:-space-launch}

* Options:  
  * Create a sub-DAO, with its own token   
  * Break out onto own, still paying back to LexDAO as appropriate

## Membership Tiers and Onboarding {#membership-tiers-and-onboarding}

### Leadership Succession Process for Operating Committee (OC), Operator (O), and Assistant Operator (AO) {#leadership-succession-process-for-operating-committee-(oc),-operator-(o),-and-assistant-operator-(ao)}

* Anyone can apply for The OC. Only a current member of The OC can apply for O and AO.  
* All roles go through the full voting process in the Operating System every time, even if only one candidate.  
* Both the O and AO can be reelected for up to 2 consecutive terms. If after 2 terms for the current O or AO, no new candidates are interested in a role, then the current O and AO can continue. O and AO can run for additional terms in the same role after taking off 2 terms. AO can do 4 consecutive terms if they do 2 terms as AO then 2 terms as O.  
* Ideally this is done by soft consensus, not a campaign, everyone who wants and contributes will get their chance.  
* Criteria for OC, O, AO:  
  * LexDAO member for at least 6 months before term starts.  
  * Earned at least one CRED for contributions to LexDAO.  
  * Pick people who have been most involved in the DAO to reward them and pay them.  
  * To become the AO or O, you must be a current member of The OC.  
* Continuity  
  * If AO is next O or either the AO or O is remaining in their role, then continuity is easier, if not, then O and AO have to train their replacements and be there for ongoing questions.  
  * The O and AO should stay on The OC for at least one quarter after their roles end.  
* For each role, candidate must respond to [these questions in this form](https://forms.gle/gTVjcJ6JQY2zYz1m6) in writing and take questions from members at both Governance Meetings:  
  * Legal education and license  
  * Background including operations, legal, LexDAO, CREDs earned, web3 experience (\<500 characters)  
  * In applying, you affirm that you have read the OS and will fulfill the responsibilities of the role  
* Around the 1st day of the month before the transition, O and AO make an open call for candidates for all roles.  
* O and AO award CREDs for contributions each quarter.

## How We Make Decisions, Governance, Voting, Requesting Funding {#how-we-make-decisions,-governance,-voting,-requesting-funding}

* DAO votes are required for these (all other rights reserved for each project / practice area):  
  * Launch Tier 2 project  
  * Set or allocate DAO budget  
  * Changes to DAO rules, such as membership  
  * Allocate and disburse money  
  * Take public position / policy endorsement  
  * Launch a hackathon  
* Process for any vote  
  * Guild Member who is sponsoring the request (“Requester”) posts in \#Operating-Committee discord channel with the request and supporting information (with goal of becoming more direct democracy and skipping this step if we can over time). If approved by The OC, then go to next steps:  
  * Requester posts request in \#Guild-Governance with the request and supporting information and tags its @Guild Members. Requester takes feedback and answers questions in discord. [Here’s a model of a post](\#snapshot-vote-proposal-for-disbursement) for you to use as a template, if helpful.  
  * Requester puts it on the agenda for the Governance Meeting. Requester takes feedback and answers questions at the meeting.  
  * If the request gets soft consensus, then requester posts in Snapshot ([https://snapshot.org/\#/lexdao.eth/](https://snapshot.org/\#/lexdao.eth/)) for a vote, announces the vote in \#Guild-Governance with a @Guild Members tag, and leaves the vote open for at least 3 business days. [Here’s a model post](\#snapshot-vote-proposal-for-disbursement).  
    * Every member of the guild uses their [LexDAO CRED](https://opensea.io/collection/lexdao-cred) token to vote  
  * Majority wins\!  
* For requesting money, must state:  
  * Who are you? What have you done for LexDAO? What CREDs have you earned?  
  * How much do you need?  
  * Where money is going?  
  * What are the goals of the spending?  
  * How it benefits LexDAO?  
  * Where money is coming from (which treasury)?  
  * Which budget line money is coming from?  
* Tier 2 Projects provide updates to the DAO in the Governance Meeting as often as the projects want, no requirements, but recommended to report at least once a month, especially if DAO funds are being spent.

## Planning and Budget {#planning-and-budget}

* [Rough budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E8a4ZADZoWoUDVF-igo0n1YVyTvAMZITZkGk6p8W7nA/edit\#gid=0)

## How to Manage Gitcoin Grants {#how-to-manage-gitcoin-grants}

* Wallet  
  * We want the wallet to be multi-chain to make it easier to receive donations  
  * Try to make it work with a multi-sig still or use an individual account that we move the money out of right away if we really have to  
    * [https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/5267779-i-sent-assets-to-a-safe-address-on-the-wrong-network-any-chance-to-recover](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/5267779-i-sent-assets-to-a-safe-address-on-the-wrong-network-any-chance-to-recover)   
    * [https://www.loom.com/share/ca34aabcd62747fb9fb89bd463b4c741](https://www.loom.com/share/ca34aabcd62747fb9fb89bd463b4c741)   
* Gitcoin grant donations can go to membership fee  
  * Don’t require that membership go through there, but we can recognize your membership if you donate \>=$300  
  * All funds go to general DAO treasury, not to any specific project, then allocated by usual DAO process and votes

## Rewarding Members of the Guild for Value Created with Money and CREDs {#rewarding-members-of-the-guild-for-value-created-with-money-and-creds}

* **Financial Payment.**  We try to pay Guild Members for their contributions when we can. But we’re still small and underfunded for all we want to accomplish. We do have a budget, and we try to spend it wisely.  
* **NFT CREDs.**  We award NFTs to Guild Members who make major contributions to LexDAO. You can [view all the CREDs we’ve awarded here](https://opensea.io/assets/cred?search\[stringTraits\]\[0\]\[name\]=providerName\&search\[stringTraits\]\[0\]\[values\]\[0\]=LexDAO\&search\[sortAscending\]=true\&search\[sortBy\]=PRICE). CRED awards must go through The OC. Some examples of contributions that we’ve awarded CREDs for in the past:  
  * Founding the LexDAO Newsletter  
  * Founding the LexDAO educational initiative, LedED  
  * Principal Author of LexDAO’s comments to Wyoming on proposed DAO law

## Legal Status {#legal-status}

* **Owner: Tertius**  
* Constitution says UNA for now, let’s go legit and file  
* Ongoing fees and paperwork  
* Wyoming attorney to be rep: TatyBann\#2373 (Tatyana)

## Conflict of Interest Policy {#conflict-of-interest-policy}

Members holding any official role or participating in any official business as agent or authorized representative of LexDAO, are subject to the following conflict of interest policy:

Definition of Conflict of Interest:   
A conflict of interest arises when a member, officer, or agent of LexDAO has a personal, financial, or professional interest which may compromise, or appear to compromise, their impartiality, judgment, or effectiveness in conducting or overseeing the activities and operations of LexDAO.

Disclosure and Recusal:  
Members are expected to disclose any existing and potential conflicts when seeking or accepting any elected or granted official position and to duly disclose any potential conflicts that may arise.

Prohibition of Self-Dealing and Collusion:   
Members are prohibited from using a position or influence within the organization to gain personal benefit or advantage, financial or otherwise, at the expense of LexDAO. Members are prohibited from engaging in secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy aimed at deceiving or defrauding LexDAO, manipulating decisions, or gaining unfair advantage.

Management of Conflicts: The Operating Committee, membership, or designated ethics committee shall examine the disclosed conflict of interest and determine an appropriate course of action. This may include additional measures to manage, mitigate, or resolve the conflict. Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, which could include termination from their role or position within LexDAO.

## Dissolution {#dissolution}

In the event of dissolution of LexDAO, all debts and obligations of the organization shall be paid, satisfied, and discharged, or adequate provision shall be made thereof. Remaining assets shall be distributed for one or more exempt purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(6) including purposes within 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or shall be distributed to the federal government, or to a state or local government, for a public purpose. No part of the net earnings or assets shall inure to the benefit of or be distributable to its members, officers, or other private persons.

## Arbitration {#arbitration}

Internal Resolution Priority: In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising from or relating to the bylaws of LexDAO or the breach thereof, parties involved shall first endeavor to settle the dispute through the internal governance framework of LexDAO. This may involve resolution through discussion within the relevant committees, or, if necessary, a vote by the general membership of LexDAO.

Mediation as a Next Step: If the matter is not resolved by such internal mechanisms, parties shall then engage in mediation efforts to seek a resolution. Mediation shall be conducted in good faith by both parties before resorting to arbitration or litigation.

Mandatory Arbitration: Should mediation fail to resolve the dispute, the parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the rules of a recognized arbitration institution, as agreed upon by the parties in the State of Wyoming, United States.

Limitation on Legal Action:   
To the fullest extent permitted by law, LexDAO and its members, officers, and agents agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. LexDAO and its members, officers, and agents also agree not to initiate or prosecute any legal suit, action, or proceeding against LexDAO in any jurisdiction outside the State of Wyoming, United States.

Jurisdiction and Governing Law: This clause and the interpretation of its terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wyoming and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Wyoming.

Severability and Integration: This arbitration clause constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to arbitration and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written between the parties with respect to this subject matter. If any part of this arbitration clause is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, the unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the enforceability of any other provision of this arbitration clause.

* For projects that have to or want to be separate from LexDAO: crowdfunding, maybe for non-legal work, aelin, for projects that want to roll into an Alt L1  
* Add tip function to let people pat each other on back  
* Add advisory council?
